    of the ticket is 'open' and in a specific queue.
    Example ofKernel/Config.pm:

    # Module Name: 1-OwnerCheck
    # (if the current owner is already the user, grant access)

    Example for Kernel/Config/GenericAgent.pm:

    # --
    'move all abc priority "3 normal" tickets to experts and change priority'=> {
      # get all tickets with these properties
      Queue => 'abc',

    },
 - (2003/11/02) added delete option to Admin->StdAttachment menu
 - (2003/11/01) added PostMaster(POP3).pl filter options like procmail.

        Module => 'Kernel::System::PostMaster::Filter::Match',
        Match => {
            From => 'noreply@',
        },

 - (2003/01/11) fixed AgentPhone bug of Time() in subject -
    Time(DateFormatLong) was shown

1.0 RC1 (2003-01-09)
 - (2003/01/09) added AgentTicketPrint (Ticket Print View)
 - (2003/01/09) improved Kernel::System::Ticket::IndexAccelerator::RuntimeDB
    and StaticDB (for locked tickets).
 - (2003/01/09) removed Kernel::System::Ticket::IndexAccelerator::FS
    because RuntimeDB and StaticDB is enough
 - (2003/01/05) improved fulltext search (added ticket state search option)
 - (2003/01/05) added CMD option to bin/GenericAgent.pl (so you can
    execute own programs on GenericAgent.pl actions - e. g. send
    special admin emails)
 - (2003/01/02) added attachments support for std. responses
 - (2002/12/27) added filters (All, Open, New, Pending, Reminder) to
    AgentMailbox (locked-ticket-view)
 - (2002/12/24) added pending feature for tickets
 - (2002/12/20) added Kernel::System::Ticket::ArticleStorage* modules
    for attachments in database or fs (needs to update the database
    (scripts/DBUpdate.(mysql|postgesql).sql)! The main reason is a lot
    of people have problems with the file permissions of the local otrs
    and webserver user (often incoming emails are shown some times again).
    TicketStorageModule in Kernel/Config.pm.
     * Kernel::System::Ticket::ArticleStorageDB -> (default)
     * Kernel::System::Ticket::ArticleStorageFS -> (faster but webserver
        user should be the otrs user - use it for larger setups!)
 - (2002/12/19) attachment support (send and view) for customer panel!
 - (2002/12/18) added config option CheckEmailAddresses and CheckMXRecord.
    CheckMXRecord is useful for pre checks of valid/invalid senders (
    reduce Postmaster emails). Disable CheckEmailAddresses if you work
    with customers which don't have email addresses or your otrs system is
    in your lan!
 - (2002/12/18) added more error handling to AgentPhone
 - (2002/12/15) added bin/PostMasterPOP3.pl and AdminPOP3 interface for
    fetching emails without procmail, fetchmail and MDA
 - (2002/12/12) added finnish translation - Thanks to Antti Kämäräinen!
 - (2002/12/08) added working PostMasterDaemon.pl and PostMasterClient.pl,
    alternative to PostMaster.pl. How it works: If the PostMasterDaemon.pl
    is running, pipe email through PostMasterClient.pl like (PostMaster.pl)
    (e. g. "cat /tmp/some.box | bin/PostMasterClient.pl"). Pro: Speed, Contra
    needs more memory.
 - (2002/12/07) added customer-user-backend Kernel/System/CustomerUser/DB.pm.
 - (2002/12/07) added preferences-backend module for user and customer user
    (Kernel/System/ (User/Preferences/DB.pm and CustomerUser/Preferences/DB.pm)
 - (2002/12/04) moved from Date::Calc (Perl and C) to Date::Pcalc (Perl only)
    and added Date::Pcalc to Kernel/cpan-lib/ (OS independent!).
 - (2002/12/01) moved GenericAgent.pm to GenericAgent.pm.dist to have tarball
    updates easier.
 - (2002/12/01) moved finally to new config file Kernel/Config.pm.dist! Learn
    more -=> INSTALL -=> "Demo config files"!
 - (2002/12/01) added "enchant LDAP auth" patch from Wiktor Wodecki for
    Kernel/System/Auth/LDAP.pm and Kernel/System/CustomerAuth/LDAP.pm -
    http://lists.otrs.org/pipermail/dev/2002-November/000043.html.
    Thanks Wiktor!

    Kernel::System::PostMaster::LoopProtection::(DB|FS).
 - (2002/11/24) added delete ticket feature for GenericAgent.pl (removes tickets
    from db and fs) - http://lists.otrs.org/pipermail/dev/2002-October/000037.html.
 - (2002/11/23) removed Kernel::Modules::AdminLanguage! Moved used languages
    to config file (Kernel/Config.pm - DefaultUsedLanguages). Moved translation
    files from long language names to short names like en, de, bg, nl, ...
    (e. g. Kernel/Language/bg.pm). Updated docu.
 - (2002/11/21) moved var/cron/* to var/cron/*.dist (.dist is not used) to make
    updates easier! Thanks to Bryan Fullerton!
 - (2002/11/15) moved %doc/install/* to /opt/OpenTRS/install in RPM-specs.
    because the web-installer needs this stuff in this location. %doc isn't
    consistent on different linux distributions!

    http://bugs.otrs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48
 - (2002/11/15) added Dutch translation! Thanks to Fred van Dijk!
 - (2002/11/14) added Bulgarian translation! Thanks to Vladimir Gerdjikov!
 - (2002/11/11) added new config file as Kernel/Config.pm.dist (will be used
    for >= OTRS 5.0 Beta9) if you want to test it with 0.5, use Kernel/Config.pm.dist
    as Kernel/Config.pm (cp Kernel/Config.pm.dist Kernel/Config.pm)!
    Kernel/Config/Defaults.pm is the config file with all defaults. If you want
    to change this settings, add the needed entry to Kernel/Config.pm(.dist)
    and the Kernel/Config/Defaults.pm will be overwrite. Updates will be much
    easier! - http://lists.otrs.org/pipermail/otrs/2002-October/000315.html
