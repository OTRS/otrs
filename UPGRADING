These instructions are for people upgrading OTRS from "3.0" to "3.1",
and applies both for RPM and source code (tarball) upgrades.

If you are running a lower version of OTRS you have to follow the upgrade path
to 3.0 first (1.1->1.2->1.3->2.0->2.1->2.2->2.3->2.4->3.0->3.1 ...)!

Please note that if you upgrade from OTRS 2.2 or earlier, you have to
take an extra step; read http://bugs.otrs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6798

If you need to do a "patch level upgrade", which is an upgrade for instance
from OTRS version 3.1.0 to 3.1.1, you should skip steps 8 and 11.

If you are using Microsoft SQL Server as the DBMS for OTRS, please refer
to the manual, chapter "Upgrading Microsoft SQL Server Data Types" for instructions
how to upgrade the data types used by OTRS.

1) Stop all relevant services
   --------------------------

    e. g. (depends on used services):

    shell> /etc/init.d/cron stop
    shell> /etc/init.d/postfix stop
    shell> /etc/init.d/apache stop


2) Backup everything below $OTRS_HOME (default: OTRS_HOME=/opt/otrs)
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

    o Kernel/Config.pm
    o Kernel/Config/GenericAgent.pm
    o Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZAuto.pm
    o var/*
    o as well as the database


3) Make sure that you have backed up everything ;-)
   ------------------------------------------------

4) Setup new system (optional)
   ---------------------------

   If possible try this install on a separate machine for testing first.


5) Install the new release (tar or RPM)
   ------------------------------------

   With the tarball:

    shell> cd /opt
    shell> tar -xzf otrs-x.x.x.tar.gz
    shell> ln -s otrs-x.x.x otrs

    Restore old configuration files.
    o Kernel/Config.pm
    o Kernel/Config/GenericAgent.pm
    o Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZAuto.pm


   With the RPM:

    shell> rpm -Uvh otrs-x.x.x.-01.rpm

    Restore old configuration files is not needed, done by RPM.

6) Own themes
   ----------

   Themes are located under $OTRS_HOME/Kernel/Output/HTML/*/*.dtl (default: OTRS_HOME=/opt/otrs)


7) Set file permissions
   --------------------

   If the tarball is used, execute:

     shell> cd /opt/otrs/
     shell> bin/otrs.SetPermissions.pl

   with the permissions needed for your system setup.


8) Apply the database changes
   --------------------------

     shell> cd /opt/otrs/


    SCHEMA UPDATE PART 1:
    =====================

    MySQL:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.1.mysql.sql | mysql -p -f -u root otrs

    PostgreSQL 8.2+:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.1.postgresql.sql | psql otrs

    PostgreSQL, older versions:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.1.postgresql_before_8_2.sql | psql otrs


    NOTE: If you use PostgreSQL 8.1 or earlier, you need to activate the new legacy driver
    for these older versions. Do this by adding a new line to your Kernel/Config.pm like this:

    $Self->{DatabasePostgresqlBefore82} = 1;


    DATABASE MIGRATION SCRIPT
    =========================

    shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.1.pl

    Do not continue the upgrading process if this script did not work properly for you.
    Otherwise data loss may occur.


    SCHEMA UPDATE PART 2:
    =====================

    MySQL:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.1-post.mysql.sql | mysql -p -f -u root otrs

    PostgreSQL 8.2+:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.1-post.postgresql.sql | psql otrs

    PostgreSQL, older versions:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.1-post.postgresql_before_8_2.sql | psql otrs


9) Refresh the configuration cache and delete caches
    -------------------------------------------------

    Please run:

    shell> bin/otrs.RebuildConfig.pl
    shell> bin/otrs.DeleteCache.pl


10) Restart your services
    ---------------------

    e. g. (depends on used services):

    shell> /etc/init.d/apache start
    shell> /etc/init.d/postfix start
    shell> /etc/init.d/cron start

    Now you can log into your system.


11) Check installed packages
    ------------------------
    In the package manager, check if all packages are still marked as
    correctly installed or if any require reinstallation or even a package upgrade.


12) Check for encoding issues
    -------------------------

    OTRS 3.1 only allows UTF-8 as internal charset.
    Non-UTF-8 installations of OTRS must switch to UTF-8.


XX) TicketHistory
    -------------

    The TicketHistory type TicketFreeTextUpdate was renamed to
    TicketDynamicFieldUpdate. If you have any custom reporting using this,
    please adjust it.


XX) Ticket Event handlers
    ---------------------

    The Event name TicketFreeTextUpdate_$Counter was renamed to TicketDynamicFieldUpdate_$FieldName.
    If you have any custom event handlers for these events, please adapt them.


XX) DynamicField User Preferences Module
    ------------------------------------

    If you had one or more active custom settings for "PreferencesGroups###Freetext",
    you need to adapt them to work with the new DynamicFields engine. The PrefKey
    setting must be changed to "UserDynamicField_DynamicField", where the part after
    the _ is the name of the dynamic field. Existing values would need to be renamed
    in the database as well.


XX) Custom free field default value event handler
    ---------------------------------------------
    If you used the event handler Ticket::EventModulePost###TicketFreeFieldDefault (not active by default),
    you'll need to migrate its configuration to the new setting Ticket::EventModulePost###TicketDynamicFieldDefault.

    The configuration of this is slightly different; where you had to specify a Counter indicating the TicketFreeText
    number previously, now you need to specify the name of the DynamicField (for migrated fields, this will be
    DynamicField_TicketFreeKey$Counter and DynamicField_TicketFreeText$Counter. You need two separate entries now
    if you want to set both the key and the text field.


XX) Escalation Events
    -----------------

    If you want to use the new escalation events in your system, you need to activate the
    corresponding GenericAgent job in Kernel/Config/GenericAcent.pm. Please look into
    Kernel/Config/GenericAgent.pm.dist for an example of how to do this.


12) Well done!
