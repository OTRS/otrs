    REPORTING A BUG OR ASKING A QUESTION
    
        Feel free to report bugs or ask questions. However, to save time
        consider the following steps first:
    
        Read the documentation:
    
            The Excel::Writer::XLSX documentation has been refined in
            response to user questions. Therefore, if you have a question it is
            possible that someone else has asked it before you and that it is
            already addressed in the documentation. Since there is a lot of
            documentation to get through you should at least read the table of
            contents and search for keywords that you are interested in.
    
        Look at the example programs:
    
            There are over 80 example programs shipped with the standard
            Excel::Writer::XLSX distribution. Many of these were created
            in response to user questions. Try to identify an example program
            that corresponds to your query and adapt it to your needs.
    
    HINTS_1
    print "Press enter ..."; <STDIN>;
    
    print << 'HINTS_2';
    
        If you submit a bug report here are some pointers.
    
        1.  Put "Excel::Writer::XLSX:" at the beginning of the subject line.
            This helps to filter genuine messages from spam.
    
        2.  Describe the problems as clearly and as concisely as possible.
    
        3.  Send a sample program. It is often easier to describe a problem in
            code than in written prose.
    
        4.  The sample program should be as small as possible to demonstrate the
            problem. Don't copy and past large sections of your program. The
            program should also be self contained and working.
    
        A sample bug report is generated below. If you use this format then it
        will help to analyse your question and respond to it more quickly.
    
        Please don't send patches without contacting the author first.
    
    
    HINTS_2
    print "Press enter ..."; <STDIN>;

    To:      John McNamara <jmcnamara@cpan.org>
    Subject: Excel::Writer::XLSX: Problem with something.
    
    Hi John,
    
    I am using Excel::Writer::XLSX and I have encountered a problem. I
    want it to do SOMETHING but the module appears to do SOMETHING_ELSE.
    
    Here is some code that demonstrates the problem.
    
        #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    
        use strict;
        use Excel::Writer::XLSX;
    
        my $workbook  = Excel::Writer::XLSX->new("reload.xls");
        my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();
    
        $worksheet->write(0, 0, "Hi Excel!");
    
        __END__
    
    My automatically generated system details are as follows:
    EMAIL
    
    
    print "\n    Perl version   : $]";
    print "\n    OS name        : $^O";
    print "\n    Module versions: (not all are required)\n";
    
    
    my @modules = qw(
                      Excel::Writer::XLSX
                      Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
                      Archive::Zip
                      XML::Writer
                      IO::File
                      File::Temp
                    );
    
    
    for my $module (@modules) {
        my $version;
        eval "require $module";
    
        if (not $@) {
            $version = $module->VERSION;
            $version = '(unknown)' if not defined $version;
        }
        else {
            $version = '(not installed)';
        }
    
        printf "%21s%-24s\t%s\n", "", $module, $version;
    }
    
    
    print << "BYE";

Example of how to use the Excel::Writer::XLSX module to send an Excel
file to a browser in a CGI program.

On Windows the hash-bang line should be something like:

    #!C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe

The "Content-Disposition" line will cause a prompt to be generated to save
the file. If you want to stream the file to the browser instead, comment out
that line as shown below.



    #!/usr/bin/perl

=head2 Example: chart_pie.pl



A demo of a Pie chart in Excel::Writer::XLSX.

The demo also shows how to set segment colours. It is possible to define
chart colors for most types of Excel::Writer::XLSX charts via the
add_series() method. However, Pie and Doughtnut charts are a special case
since each segment is represented as a point so it is necessary to assign
formatting to each point in the series.

Example of how to add data validation and dropdown lists to an
Excel::Writer::XLSX file.

Data validation is a feature of Excel which allows you to restrict the data
that a user enters in a cell and to display help and warning messages. It
also allows you to restrict input to values in a drop down list.

Example of how to use the Excel::Writer::XLSX module to send an Excel
file to a browser using mod_perl 1 and Apache

This module ties *XLSX directly to Apache, and with the correct
content-disposition/types it will prompt the user to save
the file, or open it at this location.

This script is a modification of the Excel::Writer::XLSX cgi.pl example.

Change the name of this file to Cgi.pm.
Change the package location to wherever you locate this package.
In the example below it is located in the Excel::Writer::XLSX directory.

Your httpd.conf entry for this module, should you choose to use it
as a stand alone app, should look similar to the following:

    <Location /spreadsheet-test>
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlHandler Excel::Writer::XLSX::Cgi
      PerlSendHeader On
    </Location>

The PerlHandler name above and the package name below *have* to match.

=head2 Example: outline.pl



Example of how use Excel::Writer::XLSX to generate Excel outlines and
grouping.


Excel allows you to group rows or columns so that they can be hidden or
displayed with a single mouse click. This feature is referred to as outlines.

Outlines can reduce complex data down to a few salient sub-totals or
summaries.

This feature is best viewed in Excel but the following is an ASCII
representation of what a worksheet with three outlines might look like.
Rows 3-4 and rows 7-8 are grouped at level 2. Rows 2-9 are grouped at
level 1. The lines at the left hand side are called outline level bars.


            ------------------------------------------
     1 2 3 |   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |  ...
            ------------------------------------------
      _    | 1 |   A   |       |       |       |  ...
     |  _  | 2 |   B   |       |       |       |  ...
     | |   | 3 |  (C)  |       |       |       |  ...
     | |   | 4 |  (D)  |       |       |       |  ...
     | -   | 5 |   E   |       |       |       |  ...
     |  _  | 6 |   F   |       |       |       |  ...
     | |   | 7 |  (G)  |       |       |       |  ...
     | |   | 8 |  (H)  |       |       |       |  ...
     | -   | 9 |   I   |       |       |       |  ...
     -     | . |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...


Clicking the minus sign on each of the level 2 outlines will collapse and
hide the data as shown in the next figure. The minus sign changes to a plus
sign to indicate that the data in the outline is hidden.

            ------------------------------------------
     1 2 3 |   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |  ...
            ------------------------------------------
      _    | 1 |   A   |       |       |       |  ...
     |     | 2 |   B   |       |       |       |  ...
     | +   | 5 |   E   |       |       |       |  ...
     |     | 6 |   F   |       |       |       |  ...
     | +   | 9 |   I   |       |       |       |  ...
     -     | . |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...


Clicking on the minus sign on the level 1 outline will collapse the remaining
rows as follows:

            ------------------------------------------
     1 2 3 |   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |  ...
            ------------------------------------------
           | 1 |   A   |       |       |       |  ...
     +     | . |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...
